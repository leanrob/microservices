# Microservices

This repo is meant to be a training ground for building microservices. Since the idea of microservices is that they can be different languages, I will not restrict this repo to any languages.

The following technologies are currently being explored in this repository...

- Golang
- gRPC
- go-micro
- Docker
- Kubernetes
